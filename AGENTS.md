# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` holds Expo Router screens: `app/(tabs)` for primary navigation, `app/(auth)` for onboarding, and `app/(modals)` for overlay flows; co-locate shared UI primitives within feature folders.
- `assets/` stores fonts and media referenced via `require`; keep filenames descriptive and lowercase with hyphens.
- `ios/` mirrors the native workspace generated by Expo Prebuild; only modify when adjusting native modules or bundle identifiers.
- `tamagui.config.ts` centralizes theme tokens; rely on Tamagui variants instead of ad-hoc inline styling.

## Build, Test & Development Commands
- `npm start` boots the Expo dev server for local iteration; use the QR code or simulator links for device previews.
- `npm run ios` / `npm run android` trigger platform builds through Expo; ensure Xcode or Android Studio is configured beforehand.
- `npm run web` launches the SPA previewâ€”run for quick smoke tests of navigation and layout.
- `npm run lint` enforces ESLint rules across `.ts/.tsx` files.
- `npm run typecheck` executes `tsc --noEmit` to surface typing regressions early.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Write functional React components in TypeScript; favor hooks and Tamagui primitives over class components or inline styles.
- Follow the existing 2-space indentation, single quotes, and trailing commas in multi-line literals.
- Name exported screens and components in PascalCase (`CreateProject.tsx`), utilities in camelCase, and keep route filenames descriptive (`project-details.tsx`).
- Prefer absolute imports via Expo Router aliases when referencing sibling modules.

## Testing Guidelines
- Automated tests are not yet wired up; before merging, validate critical flows via `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and manual Expo QA.
- When introducing tests, place them under `app/<feature>/__tests__/Component.test.tsx` using React Native Testing Library, and keep snapshots targeted.
- Aim for >80% coverage on new logic-heavy utilities; document any intentional gaps in the PR description.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use imperative, concise commit subjects (`Add profile tab`) matching the existing Git history; expand with context in the body when needed.
- Scope PRs narrowly, link related issues, and update descriptions with testing evidence and UI screenshots or recordings.
- Request reviews from maintainers familiar with the feature area; call out native or config changes that may impact builds.

## Environment & Asset Notes
- Fonts load via `useFonts` in `app/_layout.tsx`; register new fonts in both `assets/` and `tamagui.config.ts`.
- Keep Expo- and build-generated directories (`.expo/`, `ios/build/`) out of commits; confirm `.gitignore` stays up to date.
